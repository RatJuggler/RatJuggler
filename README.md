### I'm working on building another front-end for my [Developer Portfolio](https://github.com/RatJuggler/developer-portfolio) site and improving the [Docker build/deployment process](https://github.com/RatJuggler/my-production-docker-build) for the projects I run on my Raspberry Pi farm. At some point I would like to go back and complete [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/). I hit the wall on day 20, recovered on day 21 but then dropped out on day 22, [see my solutions](https://github.com/RatJuggler/advent-of-code/tree/master/2020) so far.
